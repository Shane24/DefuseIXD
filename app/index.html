                        User Experience design is ever-evolving, accelerating, and growing exponentially. As educators, how do we prepare the next generation of practitioners for a world that is constantly shifting and evolving? Perhaps the answer lies in a dynamic combination of offline learning and online learning. Reimagining universities (and other teaching environments) and placing them at the heart of a connected learning culture has the power to transform UX education, ensuring it is agile, up-to-date and fit for purpose. This short talk addresses the challenge we face, to <strong>ensure learning is relevant </strong> for our industry. Let's eschew outdated ivory tower curricula and embrace the power of the web to transform the future of UX education.                                </p>

                        <p> The talk is about Strategies for UX adoption in the Enterprise.Enterprise software is one of the fastest growing area for User Experience design. It's also one of the most challenging. John will explain how we address common problems such as organisational politics, fear of risk or restricted access to the end users. His presentation addresses designers and non-designers, whether they work in or for a large organisation. It is richly illustrated and supported by "real world" examples. In a nutshell, the talk covers the following: - Managing change in the Enterprise - Adopting UX design in a non-design led environment - Getting access to users</p>

                        <p class="speaker-bio">

                          Conversation is essential to design and the art of conversation is an essential design skill. John will dig into this idea and relate it to the workplace of today, he'll quote a few people much smarter than himself, and make some points about the conversations we should be having at work and at home every day. If anyone's a parent, there's a bonus wisdom-nugget for you.

                          John is a designer. His background was software development for websites, exhibition spaces and apps. In 2011 hestudied at <a href="http://ciid.dk/">CIID</a> in Copenhagen, where they conned him into doing real research with real people, prototyping-to-learn, and making considered decisions about the implications of design. He subsequently conned <a href="http://ciid.dk/">CIID</a> into hiring him as a design consultant (2 yrs) and later moved to London to work with <a href="http://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/">Future Cities Catapult</a> designing products and services which might help make cities better. John is now an independent designer, and (be warned) is carrying business cards.

                          Even when your team or business is user driven it can still be a challenge to design for the user. So what do you do when your environment is focussed on the brand and business goals? How do you advocate for the user? It can be difficult to get your voice heard, and even then how do you get the right people to listen?
                          I'll share some of my insights on getting the user inside the heads of the right people, shoe shifting as a culture and getting more from less.

                            The final barrier to a truly intuitive user experience is the ui itself. Modern patterns and close adoption to standards and heuristics still leave the user much to learn and to go wrong. Icons are misinterpreted, colors are inappropriate, calls to action are missed. In an effort to make a common experience across all devices and importantly....regions, we may invariably be leaving someone without their cake. Can the solution to all this be the conversational ui? (whoa watch out for that band wagon!) well yes and no.....

                                2016 was predicted to be the year of conversational commerce. A term used to describe how businesses and consumers will engage on more personal messaging channels. As designers this is an exciting time to explore the problems and opportunities that exist within this interaction paradigm. I believe we are just scratching the surface of a fundamental shift in human-computer interaction. For one case in point, messaging platforms surpassed social networks for daily active users by the end of 2015. Chatbots and messaging apps are growing rapidly with start-ups, developers and the big software giants trying to capitalise on the hype.
                                <br /><br />
                                Using my Interaction Design MA major project as a focus, I will share the research techniques, toolsets and methods I used to design a conceptual chatbot mobile operating system. The lessons learned and design principles I established are only just the beginning of a larger design conversation we need to have around conversational UX. This excitement is before we start discussing how we now talk to our computers on a daily basis...
